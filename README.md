# sagemaker-persistent-configuration
This is a repository for allowing persistent configuration for Jupyter notebook in sagemaker studio. It keeps persistent conda environments, bash and xonsh configurations, and includes a workaround to keep apt packages persistent. This repository uses the default EFS that Sagemaker Jupyter notebooks use.
